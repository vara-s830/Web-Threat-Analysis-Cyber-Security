# Web Threat Analysis with Machine Learning and Deep Learning
## Overview
This project implements web threat analysis using both machine learning and deep learning techniques. It leverages a variety of libraries to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance. The goal is to provide a robust framework for detecting and mitigating web-based threats such as malware, phishing, and other cybersecurity risks.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles both numerical and categorical data.
- **Machine Learning**: Includes a Random Forest Classifier for threat detection.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes a neural network for advanced threat analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes data distributions and model performance.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides tools for real-time analysis and response.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
- NetworkX: For network analysis (if applicable).
- Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizations.
- Scikit-Learn: For machine learning preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training deep learning models.
